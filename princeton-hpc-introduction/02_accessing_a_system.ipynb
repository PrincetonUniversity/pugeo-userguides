    "# 2: Accessing a System\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have chosen the system you want to work on and have been granted access, the next step is to access the system. The Princeton University HPC machines are remote resources which means that you connect and interact with them through an `ssh` session.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** These instructions assume that you are connecting from a computer that runs either Linux or MacOS. If you are using a Windows computer instead, you need an application such as the \"Ubuntu\" application that gives you similar terminal features as for Linux and MacOS.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.1: Inside the Princeton University Campus\n",
    "\n",
    "Connecting to one of the Princeton machines from within campus is straight forward: Just open up a new terminal window on your local machine and run the following command\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ssh <your_puid>@<hostname>.princeton.edu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where you substitute `<your_puid>` with your Princeton University ID and `<hostname>` with one of the following\n",
    "\n",
    "| System      | Hostname    |                           |\n",
    "|-------------|-------------|---------------------------|\n",
    "| Nobel       | nobel       | nobel.princeton.edu       |\n",
    "| Adroit      | adroit      | adroit.princeton.edu      |\n",
    "| Tigressdata | tigressdata | tigressdata.princeton.edu |\n",
    "| Tiger (CPU) | tigercpu    | tigercpu.princeton.edu    |\n",
    "| Tiger (GPU) | tigergpu    | tigergpu.princeton.edu    |\n",
    "| Della       | della       | della.princeton.edu       |\n",
    "| Perseus     | perseus     | perseus.princeton.edu     |\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if my Princeton University ID is `jdoe` and I want to connect to the CPU partition of Tiger, I would type the following in my terminal\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ssh jdoe@tigercpu.princeton.edu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first time you connect to a new system, an ssh-key will be generated for this particular host and you will be prompted to accept the generated key. You do this by typing `yes`. Then you will be prompted for a password, which is the password that is tied to your Princeton University ID (the same password as you use for your Princeton email). Finally, you will be asked for DUO authentication. Once you have completed this step, you will be connected to the desired system and can interact with it through the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.2: Outside the Princeton University Campus\n",
    "\n",
    "If you try to connect to any of the Princeton machines from outside campus, you will find that the above instructions do not work. This is because the Princeton machines are situated behind a firewall that protects them from traffic coming from the outside. Therefore, an extra step is required in order to work with the Princeton machines from outside campus.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will outline three options:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN)\n",
    "  - Provides a temporary campus network presence.\n",
    "  - Requires installing an application that supports Secure Remote Access (SRA).\n",
    "* Go through Nobel\n",
    "  - System is not behind the firewall and can be connected to directly from the outside.\n",
    "  - Can `ssh` to another system from Nobel.\n",
    "* Go through TigressGateway\n",
    "  - Intended for remote work with the large Princeton University systems.\n",
    "  - System is not behind the firewall and can be connected to directly from the outside.\n",
    "  - Can `ssh` to another system from TigressGateway.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The first two options are available to all Princeton University users, while the last one comes with access to one of the large Princeton systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.1: Use a Virtual Private Network (VPN)\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a VPN service allows you to connect remotely to Princeton's network in a secure manner. It requires you to install an application such as SonicWALL Mobile Connect which allows you to make a secure remote connection. Once the connection is set up, you can access any of the Princeton machines following the instructions in section 2.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a look at this [link](https://informationsecurity.princeton.edu/connecting-to-princeton-n) for more information on how to set up VPN for Princeton University users. If you need help setting it up, contact Princeton University OIT.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.2: Go through Nobel\n",
    "\n",
    "Nobel is one of the Princeton machines that is not situated behind the firewall. That means that we can connect to it as we would on campus, following the instructions in section 2.1. Once we are logged on to Nobel, we can connect from this machine to one of the machines that is behind the firewall. That is, if we want to work with Della from outside campus, we can go through the following steps to do so:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connect to Nobel**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ssh <your_puid>@nobel.princeton.edu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We then get prompted for our password and DUO authentication. After providing this, we will be logged in to Nobel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connect to Della**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same terminal where we just connected to Nobel, run the following command\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ssh <your_puid>@della.princeton.edu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first time we do this, an ssh-key will be generated for this host and we type `yes` to accept the key. Then we will be prompted for our password, but not DUO. This is because we already got DUO authentication when we logged in to Nobel in the previous step. After providing our password we will be logged in on Della.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2.3: Go through TigressGateway\n",
    "\n",
    "TigressGateway is a server that is meant to enable access to the Princeton clusters from outside campus. The necessary steps are nearly identical to those in section 2.2.2, but this is the recommended option if you have access to one of the large Princeton systems and want to work with it remotely. First we connect to TigressGateway, which is accessible from the outside. Once we are logged in on this machine we connect to the desired cluster. The following shows how to do this if we want to work with Della:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connect to TigressGateway**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ssh <your_puid>@tigressgateway.princeton.edu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Connect to Della**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the same terminal where we just connected to TigressGateway, run the following command\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ssh <your_puid>@della.princeton.edu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first time we do this, an ssh-key will be generated for this host and we type `yes` to accept the key. Then we will be prompted for our password, but not DUO. This is because we already got DUO authentication when we logged in to TigressGateway in the previous step. After providing our password we will be logged in on Della."
