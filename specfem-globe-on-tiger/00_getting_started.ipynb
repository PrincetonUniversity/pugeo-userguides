    "To get started on the Tiger cluster we must first be able to access it. The two systems we will be looking at in this guide are `TigerCPU` and `TigerGPU`. The former is used for running CPU code, and the latter for GPU code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to access one of these systems, open up a new terminal window on your local machine and run the following `ssh` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ssh <your_puid>@tigercpu.princeton.edu   #Replace with tigergpu to access TigerGPU\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is your first time connecting to the host, you will be given a new ssh-key for this host and asked to accept the key by typing `yes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then you will be prompted for your puid password, and DUO authentication. Once these steps are completed you should be logged in to TigerCPU/TigerGPU. Type `hostname` to check which system you are logged in to."

In this guide we will store and compile SPECFEM3D GLOBE on `SCRATCH`.\n",
