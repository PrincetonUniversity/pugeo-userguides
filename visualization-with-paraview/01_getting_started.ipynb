    "# 1: Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have a sense of what ParaView is and why we should use it, we can look at how to get started using it. We will look at two different cases. The first one being how to install and use ParaView on your personal laptop. The other one being how to work with ParaView on a Princeton University desktop computer, or on the computer clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1: ParaView on a Personal Laptop\n",
    "\n",
    "Although ParaView was designed to work with extremely large datasets, it works equally well with smaller datasets. For two-dimensional data the best route might be to stick with language-specific visualization modules such as `matplotlib` for Python, but when dealing with three-dimensional data, this approach can be cumbersome, and using a tool such as ParaView is much more attractive.\n",
    "\n",
    "ParaView can be installed in multiple ways. Either from source, or as prepackaged binaries that are available for Linux, MacOS, and Windows. The prepackaged binaries can be found on the ParaView [download page](https://www.paraview.org/download/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have downloaded the installation file for your operating system, you can install ParaView in the same way as you would install any other application. Then ParaView should be installed on your system and you can launch it and start exploring its features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2: ParaView on Princeton University Hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "If your data is too large to work with on your personal laptop, you will need to make use of ParaView on more powerful machines such as the Princeton University Hardware. How you access ParaView will differ depending on what type of system you intend to use. Here we will cover the following resources:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Desktop\n",
    "  - Office desktop computer provided by Princeton University. These usually have multiple cores and more storage than a laptop computer, making it a natural next choice if your laptop comes up short.\n",
    "* Clover\n",
    "  - In Guyot 312 there is the `Clover` visualization workstation. It is more powerful than an office desktop machine and has multiple screens which makes it easier to visualize multiple data at the same time. This option is usually sufficient for the type of visualization that we do in this research group.\n",
    "* Tigressdata\n",
    "  - If you want to work with data on the cluster, there is the `Tigressdata` machine which is intended for remote visualization of massize data. The guidelines for using this resource can be found [here](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/systems-and-services/available-systems/tigressdata). It is necessary to use a graphical desktop sharing system, like VNC, in order to use this resource. Instructions on how to use VNC with `tigressdata` can be found [here](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/faq/how-do-i-use-vnc-on-tigre).\n",
    "  \n",
    "Now that we have an overview of the available resources, we will look more closely at each one of them in turn.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2.1: ParaView on Desktop Computer\n",
    "\n",
    "On your desktop computer there are three ways that ParaView may be available. These are either as a module, as a system installation, or as a user installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Module:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Princeton University Hardware uses modules which allows users to load certain applications on demand. To check if ParaView is available on your desktop machine as a module, run the following command in a terminal window\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "module avail paraview\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If this command produces no results, ParaView is not available as a module on the system. If it comes up with one or several results, it is available as a module and can be loaded with the following command\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "module load <name_of_module>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After loading the module, ParaView can be launched by simply typing `paraview` in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**System Installation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If ParaView is not available as a module, it may still be installed and available on the system. This can easily be checked by opening a terminal window and typing `paraview`. If ParaView is installed, it should launch. If it is not installed, it should say something like\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "> paraview\n",
    "bash: paraview: command not found...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If that is the case, we can do one of two things: The first option would be to ask the system administrator to install ParaView on you machine for you. The second option is to do a user installation of ParaView on your desktop. The latter just means installing ParaView without needing administrator privileges, and we will look at this next.\n",
    "\n",
    "**User Installation**\n",
    "\n",
    "If ParaView is not available on your desktop as a module or system installation, we can install it ourselves to our user. The following instructions show how to do this for ParaView  v5.6 on a Linux Springdale 7.6 (Verona).\n",
    "\n",
    "Open up a new terminal window on your desktop machine. First we need to create a local folder where we can store the ParaView binaries. This is done as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "mkdir -p ~/bin/paraview\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Change directory to this folder\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "cd ~/bin/paraview\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Download ParaView v5.6 to the current folder\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "wget -O ParaView-5.6.0-MPI-Linux-64bit.tar.gz \"https://bit.ly/2GuvhGP\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** The above download URL has been shortened to make the above line presentable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Extract the package and clean up:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "tar -zxvf ParaView-5.6.0-MPI-Linux-64bit.tar.gz && rm ParaView-5.6.0-MPI-Linux-64bit.tar.gz\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step is to add the extracted binaries to the system path. This is done with the following command.\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "echo \"PATH=~/bin/paraview/ParaView-5.6.0-MPI-Linux-64bit/bin/:\\$PATH\" >> ~/.bash_profile\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We reload the `.bash_profile` file with the command\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "source ~/.bash_profile\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And now ParaView can be launched by typing `paraview` on the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2.2: ParaView on Clover\n",
    "\n",
    "ParaView is already available on the `Clover` system as a module. In order to load it, open up a new terminal window and run the following command to see the available ParaView modules\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "module avail paraview\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The desired module can then be loaded with\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "module load <paraview_module>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And launched by typing `paraview` in the terminal.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Only certain versions of ParaView are available on `Clover` as modules. If you want a specific version, you can install it to your user on `Clover` by following the same steps that were outlined in the previous section on using ParaView on your desktop computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "ParaView on `Clover` can also be used remotely, but requires the use of a graphical desktop sharing system, like VNC. Instructions for how to do this will be given in the following section where we will look at how to use ParaView on the Princeton University clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2.3: ParaView on Tigressdata\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to work with large amounts of data that are hosted on the Princeton University clusters, and don't want to move them to another system (desktop machine, Clover, etc.), then `Tigressdata` is your best bet. This is a workstation that is intended for remote visualization of massize data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to access this machine we have to go through an `ssh` connection. To do this, open a new terminal window on your local machine and run the following command\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ssh <your_puid>@tigressdata.princeton.edu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will take you to `Tigressdata` where ParaView is available as a module and can be loaded in the same way as was described in the instructions for `Clover`. If you want another version of ParaView, you should be able to install it to your user on `Tigressdata` by following the steps from the \"User Installation\" instructions in a previous section.\n",
    "\n",
    "To actually open ParaView through `Tigressdata` we need to use a graphical desktop sharing system, like VNC. Instructions on how to do this are given [here](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/faq/how-do-i-use-vnc-on-tigre)."
