    "# 1: EnTK on Tiger Head Node\n",
    "\n",
    "EnTK can be run directly from the head node on Tiger, but this first requires that we install it in a conda environment on the system. The following steps outlines how this is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1: Installing EnTK on the Head Node\n",
    "\n",
    "Open up a new terminal window on your local machine and log in to Tiger with an `ssh` command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "ssh <your_puid>@tigercpu.princeton.edu\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you are logged on, load the Anaconda 3 module:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "module load anaconda3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and create and activate a virtual environment for EnTK:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda create -n ve-entk python=2.7 -y\n",
    "conda activate ve-entk\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we are creating a virtual environment with Python 2.7. This is because EnTK currently is based on Python 2.7, but it will be migrated to Python 3 by the end of 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the virtual environment created and activated, we install EnTK using `pip`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install radical.entk\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This completes the installation of EnTK on the head node. Next we will test the installation with a simple example.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "**NOTE:** The Tiger resource is still not supported in the `master` branch of `radical.pilot`. Until it becomes part of the `master` branch, we require two more steps after the above install. We need to uninstall `radical.pilot` and then install it again from the `devel` branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip uninstall radical.pilot\n",
    "pip install -U git+https://github.com/radical-cybertools/radical.pilot.git@devel\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This note will be removed as soon as the `devel` branch gets merged into `master`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2: Testing EnTK installation on the Head Node\n",
    "\n",
    "Before testing the installation we need to set some environment variables. EnTK requires access to a database during runtime and RabbitMQ for internal message passing. Making these dependencies available on the head node would require administrator privileges, which we don't have, but we can circumvent the issue by using external resources to satisfy these requirements. We do this by exporting the following environment variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Radical Pilot verbose format\n",
    "export RADICAL_PILOT_VERBOSE=\"REPORT\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Database resource\n",
    "export RADICAL_PILOT_DBURL=\"mongodb://user:user123@ds043012.mlab.com:43012/princeton\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# RabbitMQ resource\n",
    "export RMQ_HOSTNAME=\"two.radical-project.org\"\n",
    "export RMQ_PORT=\"33267\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can now fetch and run the example script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "wget -O get_started_head_node.py https://bit.ly/2K6Zdge\n",
    "python get_started_head_node.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The example ran successfully if it produced a `STDOUT` file in the current directory with the content `Hello World`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.3: SPECFEM example\n",
    "\n",
    "If the \"Hello World\" example worked, we are ready to try a more relevant example which is running SPECFEM3D_GLOBE on multiple cores. The example is divided into two scripts, one for running the mesher and one for running the solver. Note that these scripts can easily be put together such that both the mesher and solver can be run in a single EnTK sesssion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**SPECFEM mesher:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to run the mesher, make sure that you are in the conda environment that we created above and that the above environment variables are set. Then the mesher script can be fetched and run as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "wget -O specfem_mesher.py https://bit.ly/2Mu5FzJ\n",
    "python specfem_mesher.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The run will take a couple of minutes, and then three files will appear in the current folder: `STDOUT`, `STDERR`, and `specfem_data.tar.gz`. The first two files contain anything that was printed to stdout and stderr during execution, and the tar-file contains `bin`, `DATA`, `DATABASES_MPI`, and `OUTPUT_FILES` which we can inspect to make sure that the mesher ran successfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we are confident that the mesher ran properly, we can move on to the solver script.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**SPECFEM solver:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you run the solver script, make sure that you are in the right conda environment, that the necessary environment variables are set, and that the mesher script ran successfully. Then the solver script can be fetched and run as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "wget -O specfem_solver.py https://bit.ly/2WmmhJm\n",
    "python specfem_solver.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The run will take about 10 minutes, and three files will appear in the current folder: `STDOUT`, `STDERR`, and `specfem_final.tar.gz`. We can inspect these files to make sure that the solver ran successfully."
